  FREQUENTLY_ASKED_QUESTIONS: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
  PRICING_QUESTION1: 'For what I will be charged for?',
  PRICING_RESPONSE1: "Different from other providers, Tago doesn't charge by the number devices, dashboards, or even for end users. Our model is based on the real usage of the services, or in other words the system charges by transactions, and by the tools that are made available for you depending on your plan.  So, the monthly bill will be a sum of the plan that you selected plus the real usage of the services. You can also include some add-ons, such as the support plans.",
  PRICING_QUESTION2: 'What is the billing cycle of Tago?',
  PRICING_RESPONSE2: 'Tago closes the billing period at midnight on the last day of each month. Invoices are generally available with the first four days of the month.',
  PRICING_QUESTION3: 'If I upgrade my plan, how will that be billed?',
  PRICING_RESPONSE3: 'We make a one-time prorated charge at the time of the upgrade for the equivalent reminder of the billing cycle. For example, if you upgrade from the Free plan to the Starter plan when there is 10 remaining days in the month, we will charge 1/3 of the Starter monthly pricing immediately when you confirm the upgrade. In the next month, we will charge the full price of the Starter plan. Also, any service usage and add-ons will be added to that next bill.',
  PRICING_QUESTION4: 'What are the payment methods accepted?',
  PRICING_RESPONSE4: 'Tago accepts most major credit cards for payment. In specific cases we may be able to invoice customers directly, talk to our sales team for questions.',
  PRICING_QUESTION5: 'Do you save credit card details?',
  PRICING_RESPONSE5: 'No. Your credit card details are not saved on our servers. In fact, all information goes directly from your computer to our payment service provider (Stripe).',
  PRICING_QUESTION6: 'If I downgrade my plan, when will I see the change to be effective?',
  PRICING_RESPONSE6: 'We will downgrade you to the new selected plan at your next renewal date. Your subscription will remain active at its current level through the end of the billing period that youâ€™ve already paid for.',
  PRICING_QUESTION7: 'If I downgrade to a free plan, what will happen with the data stored in my buckets?',
  PRICING_RESPONSE7: 'First, your subscription will remain active at its current level through the end of the billing period that youâ€™ve already paid for. Then, while in the free plan, our system will force the 30-days data retention policy - i.e. all data with timestamp older than that will be removed. So, we highly recommend that you plan this operation carefully to prevent undesired data lost.',
  PRICING_QUESTION8: 'How is the Analysis Timeout defined?',
  PRICING_RESPONSE8: 'When the Analysis runs your script, the execution time should be less than the Timeout defined for your plan. You can monitor the status using the Console feature.',
