  COLD_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT: 'Cold Chain Management',
  COLD_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 'Smart temperature tracking',
  COLD_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_FULL_DESCRIPTION: 'Apply smart sensors to monitor containers, boxes, and different types of refrigerators in your supply chain. By having more information on hand, your business will be able to reduce cargo loss and operating costs. Improve customer satisfaction or comply with regulatory environment by monitoring temperature, humidity and other variables all in real-time – combine all this with reports and notifications that will indicate when a certain condition is met or when trailers/trucks arrive or leave certain areas. All sensor data can be automatically combined or transferred to the business back-end by using our powerful API (Application Programming Interface).',
  TRANSPORTATION: 'Transportation',
  TRANSPORTATION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 'Smart tracking',
  TRANSPORTATION_FULL_DESCRIPTION: 'Combining the most advanced GPS devices in the auto industry with Tago capabilities, users are able to easily track not only the location of their vehicles, but also the driver\'s behavior, engine status, fuel level, and users can be alerted about vehicle malfunctions. With the addition of sensors, it is possible to identify the driver, the temperature of special loads and data from sensors. All information is available in real-time, and the data can be shared to create new valuable applications, such as notify when the vehicles reach certain locations or special events occur. Tago platform is already integrated with GPS providers such as Queclink, STG, and Calamp.',
  AGRICULTURE: 'Agriculture',
  AGRICULTURE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 'Real-time monitoring & action taking',
  AGRICULTURE_FULL_DESCRIPTION: 'Tago platform is already integrated with high quality sensors from partners that have strong experience in monitoring humidity, air temperature, soil moisture and temperature, grain volume, and other variables. Some algorithms have been already developed to reduce the time-to-market and risks for your own project. It is easy and safe to build solutions with Tago to control irrigation, pumps, fans, and other actuators that will improve the efficiency of labor, material, and resources.',
  MAINTENANCE: 'Maintenance',
  MAINTENANCE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 'Reducing downtime, improving experience',
  MAINTENANCE_FULL_DESCRIPTION: 'Backup generators and compressors are mission critical equipment by default. That is why good maintenance and understanding of the operation is so important for users and manufacturers. Now, companies can not only monitor their equipment remotely, but also make better predictions about when to service or alert customers about special events. Also, with the sharing capabilities of Tago, manufacturers can easily and securely share their data set with final users and partners (services, distributors, authorities, rental companies, and others). The ready-to-go App for Android and iOS gives peace of mind for supervisors and final users.',
  INDUSTRIAL: 'Industrial',
  INDUSTRIAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION: 'Reducing downtime, connecting to anywhere',
  INDUSTRIAL_FULL_DESCRIPTION: 'Critical industrial operations demand solutions with high reliability and availability levels in aggressive environments. Our customers have designed applications that monitor and control facility systems located in big centers and in remote places. A combination of cloud and edge computing is normally the best solution in such cases– and Tago capabilities fit extremely well here. By partnering with the best hardware suppliers, our clients are able to use intelligent gateways that are able to make local decisions in combination with analyses that run at Tago. Some applications for oil refinery or wood extractions can also benefit from the Tago interface with satellites.',
